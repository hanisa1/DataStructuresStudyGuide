Welcome to the **Data Structures Study Guide**, a well-structured repository designed to help you understand **essential data structures**.  

This repository provides:  
- **Clear explanations** of various data structures.  
- **Python implementations** with clear, modular code.  
- **Real-world applications** to understand practical use cases.

## **Repository Overview**  
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the **data structures and algorithms** covered in this guide:  

### **Linear Data Structures**  
| Data Structure | Description | 
|---------------|-------------|
| **Array** | Fixed-size structure storing elements in contiguous memory. |
| **Linked List** | Dynamic list with **Singly, Doubly, and Circular** variations. | 
| **Stack** | LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure. |
| **Queue** | FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure. **Includes Circular Queue, Deque, and Priority Queue**. | 

---

### **Non-Linear Data Structures**  
| Data Structure | Description | 
|---------------|-------------|
| **Binary Tree** | Tree where each node has at most two children. | 
| **Binary Search Tree (BST)** | A sorted binary tree for efficient searching. | 
| **AVL Tree** | A self-balancing BST ensuring O(log n) operations. | 
| **Red-Black Tree** | A balanced BST with additional constraints. | 
| **Heap (Min & Max)** | Complete binary tree used in priority queues. | 
| **Trie (Prefix Tree)** | Efficient word searching and autocomplete feature. | 

---

### **Graph Data Structures & Algorithms**  
| Graph Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Directed Graph (Digraph)** | Edges have specific directions. | 
| **Undirected Graph** | Edges connect both ways. | 
| **Weighted Graph** | Edges have associated weights. | 
| **Unweighted Graph** | All edges have equal weights. | 
| **Adjacency Matrix** | Graph represented as a 2D array. | 
| **Adjacency List** | Graph represented using a dictionary/list. | 
| **DFS (Depth-First Search)** | Explores as deep as possible before backtracking. |
| **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** | Explores level by level using a queue. |
